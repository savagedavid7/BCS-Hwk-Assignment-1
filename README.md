# BCS-Hwk-Assignment-1 - Overbond
## Overview and Origin

![Overbond](Images/Overbond-png.png)


* ### Name of company:


    Overbond

* ### When was the company incorporated?

    Overbond was founded in Toronto in 2015.

* ### Who are the founders of the company?

    Vuk Magdelinic

* ### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

    When the founder Vuk Magdelinic has been asked this question he has talked about the lack of "consolidated tape" in the fixed income segment of capital markets. In other words, unlike the equity or FX segments, fixed income had no centralized/transparent view of pricing between counterparties. So while large counterparties have created in-house solutions for themselves, this siloed legacy approach created an obvious opportunity for him to introduce systematic pricing to this segment. Through the use of AI and an independent/centralized offering, issuers and investors would benefit in terms of greater efficiency, transparency and hopefully greater liquidity and returns.



* ### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

    Overbond initially emerged out of the MaRS FinTech cluster, and has worked out of Communitech in the past.
    
    Overbond raised a $7.5 million seed round from Morrison Financial Services Ltd in early 2016.


## Business Activities:

* ### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

    Overbond is a digital platform that aims to make primary bond issuance easier by connecting all bond market participants - from corporate and government issuers to dealers and institutional investors.

    Overbond is the first fully-integrated platform to directly connect these counterparties. Their platform features end-to-end processing capability and a support framework for primary bond origination, namely through their dynamic pricing model. Overbond hopes that their offering can revolutionize the fixed income segment from an archaic primary bond issuance process to a transparent, secure and fully digital end to end process - from pre-issuance data analytics to end deal execution.

    More recently, the company  introduced Overbond BPS, a cloud-based solution that streamlines dealer-issuer communication and provides advanced market analytics. Every year corporate treasurers receive on average more than 2 million bond market updates by email and consume 125,000 hours of their time in managing this information in Canada alone. This problem is even bigger in the U.S. Overbond digitizes the end-to-end process, allowing dealers to focus on their clients’ needs, instead of piecing together pricing data through patchy and archaic means.

* ### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

    The Institute of International Finance reported that in 2019 the size of the global debt market – which includes publicly traded securities, such as bonds, bills, notes, commercial paper, as well as non-publicly traded loans — surpassed $250 trillion last year. Making this segments multiples larger than the equity segment.

    Overbond serves both sides of fixed income segment. Overbond allows primary issuers to use their platform for price discovery and gain a transparent view of demand for their credit and from who. On the other side, Overbond provides a digital platform for institutional investors to predict which issuers are going to come to market and when and then allows them to participate in these primary issues.


* ### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

    Data analytics and pricing has thus far been a siloed process, where dealers will maintain their own models for pricing and then offer this to the issuers. Overbond is the first end-to-end fixed income market fintech platform for AI predictive analytics for both issuers and potential investors. Overbond utilizes a proprietary AI algorithm to predict when companies are likely to issue and provide investors with potential trading ideas.

* ### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

    Overbond provides a suite of AI algorithms for predictive bond pricing that gives actionable trading ideas to investors and gives a better picture to issuers of potential demand for their bond offering. Overbond also provides data aggregation solutions and further AI algorithms for broader market surveillance and pre-trade signals.


## Landscape:

* ### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

    Overbond is in the capital markets domain. This domain hosts a number of diverse fintech startups that are often very different in terms of product offering and target market, however face similar challenges such as: regulatory hurdles and entrenched processes. While large fintech success stories have typically come from the equity segment, recently we've seen several companies attain success in either the fx market or market data analytics (like Kooltra and Canalyst here in Canada respectively). However the fixed income segment has had relatively fewer independent fintech startups, likely due to the opaque and entrenched nature of pricing and the much higher regulatory hurdle in credit compared to equity.

* ### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

    While the equity side of capital markets has had a revolution, particularly on the front end, with companies like Wealthsimple making equity investing cheap, convenient and accessible, the bond market has seen relatively few innovations over the past 30 years. 

    Specifically, as it pertains to Overbond, the capital markets domain has fully embraced Artificial intelligence and is one of the biggest spenders on AI technology today and capital markets as a whole is the most data intensive segment of the financial industry. As a result, some firms have used machine learning models for risk management and/or trading strategies - with over 80% of trading volume today being executed by algorithmic trading models. However, in the fixed income segment, we've seen a trend to automate the work-flow and trade overall at different dealers, but without any centralized, dynamic pricing of fixed income, this automation and information flow is patchy. This is where Overbond comes in - by providing a centralized platform where pricing is transparent and dynamic.


* ### What are the other major companies in this domain?

    The fixed income segment can be broken up into 4 main groups of participants: (i) issuers; (ii) underwriters; (iii) investors; (iv) data analytics providers

    * The issuers of bonds can be governments (either federal,        provincial, municipal) or corporate (typically in Canada these are fairly large corporations, as the lower quality debt market isn't as mature in Canada).

    * Underwriters typically refers to commercial or investment banks in Canada (for example, RBC, TD or CIBC etc..)

    * Investors in the primary issuance are typically large institutional investors like PIMCO or Allianz or again banks or investment banks.

    * The dominant players in the data analytics space would be Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters. Overbond wouldn't directly compete with these players, as Overbond's primary business is to connect issuers and investors and provide predictive algorithms for both of these parties to use. 



## Results

* ### What has been the business impact of this company so far?

     Overbond has built up a sizable userbase for their data analytics platform. However, I think they haven't yet led to the revolution of how bonds are issued and haven't increased accessibility in this space. Their platform has appeared to augment the pricing data that underwriters than use to bring issuers to market, while providing investors with greater clarity on upcoming issues.

* ### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

    As of late 2018, Overbond had more than 200 users, split roughly evenly between issuers and institutional investors. Overbond had 81 of 200 frequently issuing companies as clients, and approximately half of all institutional investors in Canada as subscribers. Clients include Burger King, Molson Coors Brewing, Alimentation Couche-Tard and BCE Inc.

* ### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

    Underwriters earn significant fees by matching their clients to potential investors, while providing a suite of data analytics, research and pricing. Overbond attempts to bring down fees in this opaque market by offering a subscription based data analytics/communications tool. So although Overbond hasn't replaced investment banks as a method of bond issuance, they've clearly had buy-in on their product from the issuers themselves. However, if you compare their client base to other data analytics companies (Bloomberg or Thomson Reuters) or even fintech offerings like Canalyst they haven't yet achieved widespread adoption of their product. For comparison, Canalyst has over 400+ users, including 8 of the top 10 asset managers.

## Recommendations

* ### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

    My hope is that Overbond can be the company that opens the fixed income segment up to retail investors. Today, Overbond is targeted for large issuers, primary dealers and large institutional investors. However, the obvious next step would be to offer some form of Overbond to retail investors - perhaps a condensed offering of their data analytics, that could be subscription-based. Additionally, Overbond could help pool retail investor funds to allow them to invest directly into a primary issue. This would create better pricing for the issuer, more investing opportunities for retail investors and complement Overbond's existing data analytics and pricing business.

* ### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

    Fintech disruption in the equity segment has led to a broad based adoption of mobile investing, passive investing and higher volumes/lower fees. By duplicating this disruption in the fixed income segment Overbond can benefit from the roadmap set forth by Questrade and Wealthsimple in getting retail investors to adopt their platform.

    More substantially, I believe that by getting a broader retail investment group to buy in on Overbond's platform and begin to participate directly in bond issuance, this could force primary issuers to buy in on Overbond's data analytics platform. This new retail environment could create a positive revenue feedback loop - where the more retail investors on the platform forces more issuers to use the platform, thereby enticing more institutional investors to also use the platform (perhaps subscribing at a higher fee to a more advanced data analytics platform than offered to retail).

* ### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

    This would require a new retail space built onto their existing mobile and web-based platform. Overbonds existing AI algorithms used to determine suitability for institutional investors could also be applied to the retail space. Where these algorithms for institutional investors take in existing holdings, prior purchases and stated strategy to suggest suitable trade ideas, these algorithms could input retail investors stated risk preference, KYC information and general market data (credit rating data, company fundamentals etc...) to provide investors with retail trade ideas based on upcoming bond issuance. These funds could then be pooled to provide retail investors direct access to the primary bond issuance market.

* ### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

    These algorithms are currently in use for institutional investors, while this offering would also help provide Overbond with greater access to data and stronger liquidity for issuers.
