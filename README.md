# BCS-Hwk-Assignment-1 - Overbond
## Overview and Origin

![Overbond](Images/Overbond-pic.png)


* _Name of company:_
    Overbond

* _When was the company incorporated?_

    Overbond was founded in Toronto in 2015.

* _Who are the founders of the company?_

    Vuk Magdelinic

* _How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?_

    When the founder Vuk Magdelinic has been asked this question he has talked about the lack of "consolidated tape" in the fixed income segment of capital markets. In other words, unlike the equity or FX segments, fixed income had no centralized/transparent view of pricing between counterparties. So while large counterparties have created in-house solutions for themselves, this siloed solution created an obvious opportunity for him to introduce systematic pricing to this segment. Through the use of AI and an independent/centralized offering, issuers and investors would benefit in terms of greater efficiency, transparency and hopefully greater liquidity and returns.



* _How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?_

    Overbond initially emerged out of the MaRS FinTech cluster, and has worked out of Communitech in the past.
    
    Overbond raised a $7.5 million seed round from Morrison Financial Services Ltd in early 2016.


## Business Activities:

* _What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?_

    Overbond is a digital platform that aims to make primary bond issuance easier by connecting all bond market participants - from corporate and government issuers to dealers and institutional investors.

    Overbond is the first fully-integrated platform to directly connect these counterparties. Their platform features end-to-end processing capability and a support framework for primary bond origination, namely through their dynamic pricing model. Overbond hopes that their offering can revolutionize the fixed income segment from an archaic primary bond issuance process to a transparent, secure and fully digital end to end process - from pre-issuance data analytics to end deal execution.

    More recently, the company  introduced Overbond BPS, a cloud-based solution that streamlines dealer-issuer communication and provides advanced market analytics. Every year corporate treasurers receive on average more than 2 million bond market updates by email and consume 125,000 hours of their time in managing this information in Canada alone. This problem is even bigger in the U.S. Overbond digitizes the end-to-end process, allowing dealers to focus on their clients’ needs, instead of piecing together pricing data through patchy and archaic means.

* _Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?_

    The Institute of International Finance reported that in 2019 the size of the global debt market – which includes publicly traded securities, such as bonds, bills, notes, commercial paper, as well as non-publicly traded loans — surpassed $250 trillion last year. Making this segments multiples larger than the equity segment.

    Overbond serves both sides of fixed income segment. Overbond allows primary issuers to use their platform for price discovery and gain a transparent view of demand for their credit and from who. On the other side, Overbond provides a digital platform for institutional investors to predict which issuers are going to come to market and when and then allows them to participate in these primary issues.


* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)_

    Data analytics and pricing has thus far been a siloed process, where dealers will maintain their own models for pricing and then offer this to the issuers. Overbond is the first end-to-end fixed income markets fintech platform for AI predictive analytics for both issuers and potential investors. Overbondutilizes a proprietary AI algorithm to predict when companies are likely to issue and provide investors with potential trading ideas.

* _Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)_

    Overbond provides data aggregation solutions and comprehensive suite of AI algorithms for bond pricing, bond buyer matching, pre-trade signals and market surveillance.


## Landscape:

* _What domain of the financial industry is the company in?_

    Overbond is in the capital markets domain. This domain hosts a number of diverse fintech startups that are often very different in terms of product offering and target market, however face similar challenges such as: regulatory hurdles and entrenched processes. While large fintech success stories have typically come from the equity segment, recently we've seen several companies attain success in either the fx market or market data analytics (like Kooltra and Canalyst here in Canada respectively). However the fixed income segment has had relatively fewer independent fintech startups, likely due to the opaque and entrenched nature of pricing and the much higher regulatory hurdle in credit in compared to equity.

* _What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?_

    While the equity side of capital markets has had a revolution, particularly on the front end, with companies like Wealthsimple making equity investing cheap, convenient and accessible, the bond market has seen relatively few innovations over the past 30 years. Specifically, the 

    Specifically, as it pertains to Overbond, the capital markets domain has fully embraced Artificial intelligence and is one of the biggest spenders on AI technology today and capital markets as a whole is the most data intensive segment of the financial industry. As a result, some firms have used machine learning models for risk management and/or trading strategies - with over 80% of trading volume today being executed by algorithmic trading models.

    However, in the fixed income segment, we've seen a trend to automate the work-flow and trade overall at different dealer, but without any centralized, dynamic pricing of fixed income, this automation and information flow is patchy without the introduction of systematic pricing offering from Overbond.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

    

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

    My hope is that Overbond can be the company that opens the fixed income segment up to retail investors. Today, Overbond is targeted for large issuers, primary dealers and large institutional investors. However, the obvious next step would be to offer some form of Overbond to retail investors - perhaps a condensed offering of their data analytics, that could be subscription-based. Additionally, Overbond could help pool retail investor funds to allow them to invest directly into a primary issue. This would create better pricing for the issuer, more investing opportunities for retail investors and complement Overbond's existing data analytics and pricing business.
